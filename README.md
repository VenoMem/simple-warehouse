Warehouse project for OOP in C++

Project lets user create and destroy warehouses. Each warehouse
has its own sitetrolley and shelves. Every product has its own ID. We can add
new product and thier amounts and take them from the warehouse.
Each trolly has limited weight capacity so the users have to be careful about
what and how much do they want to place on the trolly.
